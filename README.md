# Higher $\tau$-tilting theory for linear Nakayama algebras

This project provides an interactive tool to visualize the higher $\tau$-tilting theory of linear Nakayama algebras with homogeneous relations based on the results of the article [τ_d-tilting theory for linear Nakayama algebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19505). 

## Features:
- Construction of $\tau_d$-rigid pairs, with an easy way to check if they are summand maximal.
- Mutation of summand maximal $\tau_d$-rigid pairs.
- Construction of $d$-torsion classes.
